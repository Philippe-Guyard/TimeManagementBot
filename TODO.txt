First priority:
-Create a 'Task' class and modify show method so that it shows tasks as buttons
-When you click on a 'Task' button it shows more info about the tasks
-Task class can have name, deadline, type (daily, weekly) etc...
-Create JSON encoder/decoder for Task class
-Make a counter for all the completed tasks to track progress?
-Create a 'Project' class which has multiple tasks. A project also has completion percentage

Task class:
-Name
-Deadline (None if no deadline)
-Schedule type (daily, weekly, monthly)
-Schedule value
